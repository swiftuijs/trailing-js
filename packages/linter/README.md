An ESLint 9/10 flat-config plugin for Twill, a TypeScript-based language with Swift-inspired syntax extensions. Lint `.twill` and `.twillx` with typescript-eslint rules, original-source diagnostics and conservative fixes.

Install in your application:

```sh
pnpm add -D @swiftuijs/twill-linter eslint
```

`eslint.config.mjs`:

```js
import twill from '@swiftuijs/twill-linter';
export default [
  { ignores: ['**/dist/**'] },
  ...twill.configs.recommended,
  { languageOptions: { globals: { console: 'readonly' } } },
];
```

```sh
pnpm exec eslint src
pnpm exec eslint src --fix
```

`recommended` supplies standard JS and typescript-eslint recommended rules. `recommendedTypeChecked` additionally supplies typed rules; Twill files need a nearby tsconfig and are checked against Twill's virtual TypeScript program. Native TS files use typescript-eslint's project service normally. Add ordinary framework/environment globals as with any ESLint project.

`recommendedTypeChecked` also enables `@typescript-eslint/switch-exhaustiveness-check`. A switch over a discriminated union must explicitly cover each variant, even when it has a `default` branch. Adding a variant then exposes missing handlers in both Twill and native TS files. This check is opt-in linting, not a new compiler guarantee; run ESLint in CI to enforce it. Ordinary `recommended` does not require type information. See [practical patterns](https://twill.evecalm.com/patterns) for an example.

The processor honors the project Twill/JSX settings. Generated-only diagnostics are suppressed. Fixes and suggestions are offered only when their ranges and replaced text map exactly to original source; fixes requiring compiler-generated syntax are withheld. `disposeProjects()` releases the cached typed projects when embedding the plugin in a long-lived process. The typed cache checks existing project/configuration file mtimes; restart linting after adding/deleting files to refresh discovered roots.

For VS Code, use Microsoft's ESLint extension and add `twill-typescript` and `twill-tsx` to `eslint.validate`. The Twill VSIX supplies language IDs and TypeScript diagnostics; ESLint supplies lint rules and fixes.

Custom rule overrides should also match the virtual TS/TSX files, as with other ESLint processors:

```js
{ files: ['**/*.{ts,tsx,twill,twillx}'], rules: { 'prefer-const': 'error' } }
```

Framework ESLint plugins can attach their ordinary TS/TSX rules to these virtual files. Keep ESLint formatting rules disabled and let Prettier handle layout; rewrites spanning generated syntax cannot always be mapped back safely.

## Unreleased language work

Unreleased source work includes associated-value enums and accepted `match` expressions: `match (state) { case State.loaded({ value }): value; default: 0; }`. Named payload bindings and erased factory descriptors compile to native switches without calling factories. Native switch statements retain JS fallthrough; match and switch expressions return one result without fallthrough. These additions are not included in npm/Marketplace 0.1.2. Compiler, formatter, linter, highlighter, export and editor changes are validated together. See [syntax and compatibility](https://twill.evecalm.com/syntax#match-expressions-unreleased) and [RFC 0016](https://github.com/swiftuijs/twill/blob/main/docs/rfcs/0016-pattern-matching.md).
